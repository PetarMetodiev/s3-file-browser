# Create a “single page” react app that implements a simple browser for an AWS S3 bucket.
1. Non-functional requirements.
- The presented solution should be as close as possible to production ready.
- Your implementation can be a partial solution. It’s up to you where you will draw the line and send it to us.
- The task shouldn’t require backend implementation. It should be possible with frontend-only (in browser).
- You should use react and typescript.
- You should not use a CSS framework (e.g. Bootstrap, Foundation, Bulma)
- You should not use a component library (e.g.Material UI, React-Bootstrap, Fluent UI).
- We recommend using the S3 module of aws-sdk for communication with the s3 bucket.

2. Data - use the S3 API in order to list, create and delete objects in a bucket.
- To connect to S3, use the credentials provided in the email with this task
- S3 is not a filesystem, but you can treat prefixes in object names as directories.
  - You can assume that all objects are text files.
  - An object name of the form **prefix/subprefix/object.txt** can be interpreted as an absolute path to the file name **object.txt**.
  - Note that there is no concept like an empty directory in s3, and part of the task is to devise a way of handling that.
  - To represent the structure given below, you will need those three objects:
    - **object1.txt**
    - **prefix/object2.txt**
    - **prefix/subprefix/object3.txt**

- You should know that the S3 API allows for such operation on a bucket:
  - List all objects in a bucket.
  - List objects in a bucket starting with some prefix.
  - Creating an object with a given name.
  - Getting object data given its name.
  - Deleting an object given its name.

3. Functional spec
- The main goal is to enable users to:
  - Browse an S3 bucket as a filesystem.
  - Create, Read and Delete text files represented as objects in the s3 bucket. No need to update existing.

4. UI/UX
- The user interface can be minimalistic but yet should showcase your understanding of UI which is easy to work with and look at.
- On first interaction the user should be asked to configure some settings:
  - S3 Secret Key
  - Access Key ID
  - The bucket name
- The config should be remembered for subsequent use of the system.
- It should present a simple, file browser-like interface that organizes the bucket by prefixes.
- The file browser should consist of two parts:
  - Currently working directory view (on the right) that:
    - Displays the entire content (files and directories) of the so-called “current working directory.”
    - Initially the root directory is considered “current”
    - It should allow you to navigate up and down the directory structure in some way.
    - It should allow you to read the content of a file
    - It should allow you to create new subdirectories.
    - It should allow you to create new files with a given content.
    - It should allow you to delete files.
  - Tree view (on the left) that:
    - Shows only directories.
    - Initially it will show only the root subdirectories.
    - A directory containing subdirectories should be marked so the user can understand that it can be expanded.
    - When a marked directory is clicked, it should be expanded, and its subdirs should be displayed.
    - If an expanded directory is clicked, it should be collapsed, and all its subdirs should be hidden.
    - If an expanded directory is clicked, it should be collapsed, and all its sub-dirs should be hidden.
    - If a directory is double-clicked, it should be selected as the current directory and displayed in the other view.
    - The current working directory should always be visible in the tree view and should be “decorated” in some way.
- The web app should be able to detect changes to the bucket and react appropriately by removing non-existent or displaying new directories or files.
